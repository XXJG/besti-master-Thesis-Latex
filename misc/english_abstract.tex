	In recent years, dielectric resonator antennas (DRA) and broadband printed slot antennas have been widely studied owing to their good performances. Due to their several advantages such as wide bandwidth, high efficiency and ease of excitation, DRAs have been widely used in millimeter wave regions. Broadband printed slot antennas are widely used in modern wireless communications due to their advantages of low profile, simple fabrication process and ease of integration with circuits. This dissertation is mainly concerned with the design and implementation of various DRAs and broadband printed slot antennas. The author's major contributions are outlined as follows:
